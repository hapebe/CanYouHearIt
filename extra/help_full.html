<a name="quick_start"><h3>Quick Start Instructions</h3></a>
<p>First of all, have you already run the program? For a short function check, just <b>click the icon
in the top-left corner of this window</b>.
If that does work, you're lucky - and I'm surprised.
If you get an error message, you'll have to download and install the Java Runtime Environment 1.3 . See
<a href="#requirements">Requirements</a> for further help.
</p>
<p>When the program is ready, you will see it's Surface. If you get a "Midi not available" error, see <a href="#requirements">Requirements</a>
<ul>
<li>Choose <b>Series of Intervals</b> or <b>Series of Chords</b> from the user menu. You are now in a lesson!
<li>Now Press the <b>Play Button</b> You hear the sound you should analyze. If you don't hear anything, see <a href="#faq_nosound">FAQ</a>.
<li>Choose the base tone and the type of the sound. Just click on one of the buttons.
<li>If you're sure you can't guess any better, press <b>Guess</b>.
<li>You get an evaluation of your trial now, then it's up for the next task. Again <b>Play</b> and so on...
<li>Your current progress in the lesson is shown below the Play and Stop button. One Lesson consists of 50 exercises.
If you're finished with a lesson, you get a more comprehensive evaluation screen, and then you're free to start something new.
Just in case you don't want to fulfil all these tasks just now, or anyway at anytime, you can activate
<b>Save&amp;Exit</b> from the File Menu. It's then, that you're shown a message that should make you read on at <a href="#applet_application">Applet/Application</a>.
</ul>
That's all you absolutely need to know.
</p>

<a name="train_interval"><h3>Train interval recognition</h3></a>
<p>Choose <b><u>U</u>ser</b> / <b>Tra<u>i</u>n Intervals</b> to start a lesson of this type.</p>
<p>This lesson type create <b>randomly chosen intervals between a minor second and an octave</b>.
The base tone can vary from C1 to C5, i.e. the higher, second tone can be C#1 to C6.
The two notes are played as a chord, when you press the play button.
<b>You should specify the base tone and the interval</b> (defining the second note, too.) by pressing
the appropriate buttons. <b>You can omit these clicks</b>, but that will be taken as wrong.
If you're sure you can't do better, <b>press <u>G</u>uess</b>. After the evaluation message,
the lesson continues with the next interval.
</p>
<p>In the type button field there are some <b>abbreviations</b>:
<ul>
<li> <b>&lt;</b> means a minor interval ( "&lt;2" means minor second )
<li> <b>&gt;</b> means a major interval
<li> tt stands for Tritonus (the interval that consists of three whole notes)
</ul>

<a name="train_chord"><h3>Train chord recognition</h3></a>
<p>Choose <b><u>U</u>ser</b> / <b>Train <u>C</u>hords</b> to start a lesson of this type.</p>
<p>This lesson type creates <b>randomly chosen chords</b> of certain types (see <a href="#chord_type_abbr">Abbreviation Table</a>).
The base tone can vary from C1 to C5, the additional notes are all higher in the current version.
The chord sounds when you press the play button.
<b>You should specify the base tone and the chord type</b> by pressing
the appropriate buttons. <b>You can omit these clicks</b>, but that will be taken as wrong.
If you're sure you can't do better, <b>press <u>G</u>uess</b>. After the evaluation message,
the lesson continues with the next chord.

<a name="statistics"><h3>Statistics</h3></a>
<p>"Can You Hear It?" records your success and failure...<br>
While practising a type of lesson, you see a colorful section on the right. In general, green means
good and red means bad. The stats are assorted by the <i>type</i> of sound and additionally, for the
every single <i>base tone and type</i>. If you move your mouse over a single section of the stats, a
tooltip appears telling you your overall performance on that special item.
</p>
<p>Some notes on the statistics:
<ul>
<li><b>Stats can only be saved from session to session in Application mode!</b> (<a href="#applet_application">Applet/Application</a>)
<li>Stats are automatically loaded on every user login.
<li>Stats are automatically saved on exit or switch user.
<li>The length of the color bars increases with the number of trials on the concerned sound.
<li><b>Stats are only modified after a guess. Starting a new lesson or quitting etc. doesn't affect the stats.</b>
<li><b>Don't panic if you see nothing: Stats are only visible during a lesson.</b>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="user_management"><h2>User Management</h2></a>
<p>This feature applies only to the Application Mode. (<a href="#applet_application">Applet/Application</a>)
"Can You Hear It?" supports more than one user at one machine.
<ul><li>Every user has his or her own stats record.</ul>
That makes it easier for everyone to keep track of one's progress. For the moment, the different user accounts are
<i>not</i> secured by a password or such a thing. Probably I'll include that in future versions.<br>
The usage is very simple, indeed:<br>
When you launch "Can You Hear It?" as an Application, you're immediately prompted for your user name.
<ul><li>If, right now, you have never chosen one before: just type in any name you want. That's your user name now.</ul>
The current user is now showing in the menu bar (<b><u>U</u>ser:xxxx...</b>). All your efforts are now recorded
personally for you. The next time you "log in" with the same user name, your statistics are available again.
If you want to change the current user from the running program, <b><u>S</u>witch User...</b> in the <b><u>U</u>ser menu</b>.

<a name="applet_application"><h2>Applet? Application?</h2></a>
<p>
"Can You Hear It?" is a Java program. Java provides two ways to run programs on a desktop computer: "Applets" and "Applications".
Applets are more popular; they are supported by the major internet browsers. That means, they run within common HTML-Pages.
Applications are (almost) stand-alone programs like any other software on your computer.
<b>"Can You Hear It?" runs both as an applet and as an application.</b> If you run it in application mode, you profit of
the application's ability to read and write files. <b>The applet version cannot save&amp;load stats, because applets are not allowed
to access the file system of your computer.</b><br>
To run "Can You Hear It?" as an application, you have to
<ol>
<li>Add the Java Interpreter to your command path. (Windows users: add <code>path %path%;c:\jre1.3\bin\</code> to your <code>c:\autoexec.bat</code> ,where <code>c:\jre1.3\bin\</code> must be replaced ba the directory containing <code>java.exe</code> . You have to restart your computer, then.)
<li>Open a shell or command prompt.
<li>Change directory to the "Can You Hear It?" directory (where you installed it to).
<li>Type in: <code>java Music<em class="small">&lt;ENTER&gt;</em></code>
</ol>
Instead of step 2-4, Windows users simply can double-click <b>cyhi.bat</b> provided in the program directory.<br>
If you can't start "Can You Hear It?" at all, read on at <a href="#requirements">Requirements</a>.

<a name="requirements"><h2>Requirements</h2></a>
<p>
Going insane about getting cryptic error messages? Class not found? Well:
"Can You Hear It?" 1.0 is quite fastidious.<br>
You need:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/"><b>Java 2 Platform Runtime Environment Version 1.3 including Java Plug-In</b></a> for your computer system
<li>A soundcard with a MIDI synthesizer. With a Non-Windows operation system you should not even need a MIDI capable sound card, but that's something I don't
know. Those guys at Sun say so.
</ul>
The capabilities of your standard browser are <i>not sufficient</i> for this program! "Can You Hear It!" uses progressive sound
technologies, which aren't available with older Java versions supported by Netscape Navigator or MS Internet Explorer.<br>
You won't even succeed with a Java 1.2 version on your computer!
</p>

<a name="faq"><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2></a>
<a name="faq_nosound"><h4>I don't hear any sound at all!</h4></a>
<p>Are you sure you did not get an error message such as "<code>Couldn't open MIDI Sythesizer</code>"?<br>
If that is the case, either there is another programm using the MIDI-Syntesizer
(maybe another instance of the program in another browser window?) or there's a general problem with MIDI synthesis.
You can check your soundcard configuration and retry.<br>
If there is no error message but no sound, either: All I can advise you is to check your Speakers/Headphones and their plugs and
your Mixer Software. Probably MIDI synthesis is deactivated there...?<br>
Sorry, if that didn't help...
</p>

<img src="img/hr.gif">
<h4>Can I improve the quality of sound?</h4>
<p>Maybe. If you use a Non-Windows System and haven't yet downloaded the "Java Soundbank - deluxe" you could do that.
<ul><li><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/sound/"><b>http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/sound/</b></a>
</ul>
Download the deluxe soundbanks and follow the Install Directions. The next time you run "Can You Hear It?", you should be able to hear it...
</p>

<img src="img/hr.gif">
<h4>Why doesn't the "Mac" Look&Feel work?</h4>
<p>I don't know; I use the official way to establish it. Ask Sun...</p>

<img src="img/hr.gif">
<a name="absolute"><h4>How am I supposes to guess base tones?</h4></a>
<p>Indeed, few people can tell the absolute pitch of some tone as they hear it. However, maybe you are
one of them?<br>
As you become more experienced, you will find it useful to determine the current base tone remembering
the previous one...
Finally you don't have to worry if you fail most of the time - that's just normal amongst amateurs.
